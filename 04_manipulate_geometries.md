In addition to geometry storage, retrieval, and summarization, PostGIS provides us with a number of tools for direct manipulation of geometries, from everyday manipulations like coordinate tranformations, to more fundamental manipulations and constructions.

In this exercise, we will visualize a dataset that will be constructed at run-time from QGIS through PostGIS. This is an approach that performs acceptably for small datasets, and keeps our code writing simple for such use cases.

Also, to demonstrate fundamental
